# ResponsivePortfolio

This responsive designed portfolio ensures that it will render well on a variety of devices and 
windows or screen sizes.

Step one was to use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. The portfolio includes a navbar, a responsive layout, and responsive images.  

This project is a functional, deployed application. It has a GitHub repository with a README describing the project. The navbar is consistent on each page. The navbar contains links to Home/About, contact, and a portfolio page. All links work and I use semantic HTML throughout the assignment.

  Bootstrap components and grid system was properly utilized and the project included personal information including a bio, name, image, and links to my social media.
